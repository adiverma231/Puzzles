<p>
Given a positive integer $n$, consider the following process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Place $n$ stones at position $0$ on the real line, and initialize $i = 0$.</li>
<li>If there are $m$ stones at position $i$, move $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ stones from position $i$ to position $i+1$, and move another $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$ stones from position $i$ to $i+3$.</li>
<li>Increment $i \colon= i+1$ and return to Step 2.</li></ol>

<p>
For some values of $n$ this process terminates; for others it continues indefinitely. In either case, there is a finite set of singleton stones that are left behind at each position $i$ where $m$ was odd. A singleton is <dfn>lonely</dfn> if it is at least distance $3$ from any other singleton. We call a positive integer $n$ <dfn>sad</dfn> if all singletons left behind are lonely.</p>

<p>
The first sad integer is $1$, trivially. The second is $68$, which leaves behind singletons at positions $2, 5, 8, 13$. The third is $90$, which leaves behind only two singletons at positions $1$ and $13$.</p>

<p>
Define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all sad integers $n$ which leave behind singletons only at positions $0 \le i &lt; k$. For example $S(14) = 159$ and $S(30) = 33438$.</p>

<p>
Find $S(80)$.</p>
